Matches often took place between neighboring villages or towns, involving large numbers of players and covering vast distances.
 In the 19th century, efforts to standardize the game began. Various schools and universities in England developed their own versions, leading to the establishment of the modern sport. The formation of the Football Association (FA) in 1863 was pivotal, providing standardized rules.Football's popularity soared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, both within Europe and internationally. Leagues and competitions sprang up worldwide, and the establishment of FIFA in 1904 further boosted its global appeal. Professionalism emerged in the early 20th century, with the formation of professional clubs and players. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became a cornerstone event in football, drawing billions of viewers globally. In the modern era, football has continued to evolve with advancements in technology, tactics, and player fitness. Its popularity remains unmatched, with millions of fans worldwide attending matches, watching on television, and engaging with football-related content online.
